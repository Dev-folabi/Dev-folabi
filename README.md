## 🎯 Core Expertise

### 💰 Fintech & Payment Systems
I've built end-to-end payment solutions handling real transactions, from wallet management to escrow systems. I understand the complexity of financial operations, regulatory considerations, and the critical importance of security and accuracy.

### 🏗️ Scalable Backend Architecture
Specializing in designing systems that grow with the business. From monoliths to microservices, I architect solutions that balance complexity with maintainability.

### 🔐 Security & Compliance
In fintech, security isn't optional. I implement encryption, secure authentication, transaction validation, and fraud prevention mechanisms as standard practice.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Slow systems cost money. I optimize database queries, implement caching strategies, and design APIs that respond in milliseconds, not seconds.

## 📚 My Learning Journey

I didn't start as a backend engineer. Like many developers, I stumbled into it through curiosity and necessity.

**Early Days:** Started with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, building simple websites for friends and local businesses.

**The Turning Point:** A client needed a booking system with payments. That's when I discovered Node.js and fell in love with backend engineering.

**Deep Dive into Fintech:** Working on payment systems taught me more about software engineering than any course could. Every bug could mean someone's money disappearing. Every slow query could crash during peak transactions. Every security flaw could expose thousands of users.

**Current Focus:** I'm obsessed with **distributed systems**, **system design**, and **how to build software that scales**. Reading papers, watching tech talks, and implementing patterns from companies like Netflix, Uber, and Stripe.

---

## ✨ Beyond the Code

* 💡 I **mentor aspiring developers** on Twitter and in local tech communities
* 📝 I write **technical articles** about fintech and backend engineering (planning to start a blog soon!)
* 🎯 I believe in **building in public** — sharing wins, failures, and lessons learned
* 🌍 Passionate about **solving African problems with technology** — especially in fintech and education
* 📖 I love reading about **system design**, **distributed systems**, and **payment architectures**
* 🤝 Open to **collaborations** on projects that make a real difference

---

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I'm not just building software — I'm building **solutions that empower people**.

In Nigeria, and across Africa, access to financial services is still a challenge. Traditional banking systems exclude millions. E-commerce is growing but trust is low. Education is expensive and inaccessible to many.

**Technology can fix this.**

Every payment system I build makes transactions easier. Every e-learning platform expands access to education. Every line of code is a small step toward a more inclusive digital economy.

That's why I code. That's why I wake up excited to solve hard problems.
